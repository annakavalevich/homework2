# Git instruction and Overview

**What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It helps you track changes in your files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people.

## **Purpose of Git:**

**Version Control**: Track changes in your project files over time.

**Collaboration**: Work with multiple people on a project, merging changes and resolving conflicts.

**Backup**: Keep a history of your project that can be restored to previous states if needed.

**Branching and Merging**: Experiment with different features or fixes in isolated branches and merge them back into the main project when ready.

## **Basic Git Commands**:

### **Clone a Repository:**

1. **git clone <repository-url>**
   Copies an existing repository to your local machine.
   Check Status:

2. **git status**
   Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
   Add Changes:

3. **git add <file-name>** (Add a specific file)
   git add . (Add all changes)
   Stages changes for the next commit.

### **Commit Changes:**

1. **git commit -m "Commit message"**
   Records changes to the repository with a descriptive message.

### Push Changes:

1. **git push origin <branch-name>**
   Uploads local changes to a remote repository.

### **Pull Changes:**

1. **git pull origin <branch-name>**
   Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository to your local branch.

### **Create a New Branch:**

**git checkout -b <new-branch-name>**

> Creates and switches to a new branch for separate development.

### **Switch Branches:**

**git checkout <branch-name>**

> Switches to an existing branch.

### **Merge Branches:**

1. **git checkout <target-branch>**
2. **git merge <source-branch>**

   Combines changes from one branch into another.

### **View Commit History:**

**git log**

> Displays the commit history for the repository.

## **Additional Git Commands:**

### **View Differences:**

**git diff**

Shows changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

### **Undo Local Changes:**

1. **git checkout -- <file-name>** (Revert changes in a specific file)
2. **git reset HEAD <file-name>** (Unstage a file)

### **Delete a Branch:**

1. **git branch -d <branch-name>** (Delete a local branch)
2. **git push origin --delete <branch-name>** (Delete a remote branch)

### **Stash Changes:**

1. **git stash** (Save changes for later)
2. **git stash apply** (Reapply stashed changes)

### **Clone a Repository**

> To clone a repository, use:

git clone <repository-url>

### **Add a Remote Repository**

> To add a new remote repository, use:

**git remote add <remote-name> <repository-url>**

### **View Remote Repositories**

> To list all remote repositories, use:

**git remote -v**

### **Fetch Updates from Remote**

> To fetch updates from a remote repository without merging, use:

**git fetch <remote-name>**

### **Pull Changes from Remote**

> To fetch and merge changes from the remote repository, use:

**git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>**

### **Push Changes to Remote**

> To push your local changes to the remote repository, use:

**git push <remote-name> <branch-name>**

### **Remove a Remote Repository**

> To remove a remote repository, use:

**git remote remove <remote-name>**

### **Rename a Remote Repository**

> To rename a remote repository, use:

**git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>**

### **View Remote Branches**

> To see all branches in the remote repository, use:

**git branch -r**

### **Track a Remote Branch**

> To start tracking a remote branch, use:

**git checkout --track <remote-name>/<branch-name>**

# **Conclusion**
